Assign 2: Client/Server Application

Included Files:
	* client directory
		* client.cpp
	* server directory
		* digraph.cpp
		* digraph.h
		* dijkstra.cpp
		* dijkstra.h
		* heap.h
		* server.cpp
		* wdigraph.h
	* README
	* Makefile
	* plotter

Running Instructions:
	1. Run the makefile by tying in terminal "make"
	2. The plotter gui will show up. Select two points.
	3. A path will show up indicating the shortest route
	   If no path is displayed it means there is no
	   shortest path between your two selected points.
	4. Keep selecting points as much as you want.
	5. To quit the program, click on the "X" icon on
	   the top-right of the screen.

Notes and Assumptions:
	My implementation of the socket connection and pipe
	connections is based on the code done in-class.

	There is a possibility of the client and/or server
	crashing upon starting up. To resolve this try
	restarting the virtual machine.

Makefile Targets:
	all: Runs the server, client, and plotter executables
	server: Links the object files for server
	server.o: Compiles server.cpp
	dijkstra.o: Compiles dijkstra.cpp
	digraph.o: Compiles digraph.cpp
	client: Links the object files for client
	client.o: Compiles client.cpp
	clean: Removes all executables, objects, and named pipes
